Assignment: Lead Gen Business
1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?
SELECT MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) as Month, SUM(amount) as Revenue FROM billing

WHERE year(charged_datetime) = 2012 AND month(charged_datetime) = 3

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?
SELECT client_id as Client, SUM(amount) as Total_Revenue FROM billing

WHERE client_id = 2

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?
SELECT client_id as Client, domain_name FROM sites

WHERE client_id = 10

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?
SELECT client_id AS Client, COUNT(domain_name) AS Total_Sites, created_datetime FROM sites

WHERE client_id = 1

GROUP BY year(created_datetime)
GROUP BY month(created_datetime)

SELECT client_id AS Client, COUNT(domain_name) AS Total_Sites, created_datetime FROM sites

WHERE client_id = 20
GROUP BY year(created_datetime)
GROUP BY month(created_datetime)

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?
SELECT COUNT(site_id) AS Total_Leads, registered_datetime AS Reg_Jan_Feb FROM leads

WHERE registered_datetime 

BETWEEN '2011/1/1' AND '2011/2/15' 

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
SELECT clients.first_name AS Client_Name, COUNT(leads.first_name) AS Lead_Total FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE leads.registered_datetime

BETWEEN '2011/1/1' AND '2011/12/31'

GROUP BY clients.first_name

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?
SELECT clients.first_name AS Client_Name, COUNT(leads.first_name) AS Lead_Total FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE leads.registered_datetime

BETWEEN '2011/1/1' AND '2011/6/31'

GROUP BY clients.first_name

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  
Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.
SELECT clients.first_name AS Client_Name, COUNT(leads.first_name) AS Lead_Total FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

WHERE leads.registered_datetime

BETWEEN '2011/1/1' AND '2011/6/31'

GROUP BY clients.first_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id

SELECT clients.first_name AS Client_Name, sites.domain_name AS Site_Names, COUNT(leads.first_name) AS Lead_Total FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

GROUP BY sites.domain_name

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.
SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, SUM(amount), billing.charged_datetime FROM billing, clients

GROUP BY clients.first_name, year(charged_datetime), month(charged_datetime)

ORDER BY clients.client_id, year(charged_datetime)

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
SELECT clients.first_name AS Owner, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name SEPARATOR ', ') AS Sites FROM clients

JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

GROUP BY clients.first_name
