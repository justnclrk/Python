Fun with Functions
Go ahead and follow along with the video to practice more SQL commands. 


Functions can be applied to the selected columns. There can be a variety of reasons why you might want to use functions. Below are some of the most commonly used functions separated by the purpose for using them. Get familiar with how to use some of these functions, but DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE ALL OF THESE. If you understand how functions work, then you should be able to quickly reference a function and understand how to use it.

When calling a function on a column, make sure that column is the appropriate Data Type for that function.

Text Functions Data Types (VARCHAR, TEXT, CHAR etc.)

Numeric Functions Data Types (INT, BIGINT, FLOAT etc.)

Date and Time Functions Data Types (DATETIME)

SELECT FUNCTION (column) FROM table_name

To see the different types of formatting for DATE_FORMAT() look here:  SQL Date Format. 

Again, DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE THESE FUNCTIONS. You should be aware of the types of functions that exist, and look up the details only when needed. For example, the RAND() function above actually returns a decimal number as low as 0 and as high as "almost 1.0". Is this detail worth memorizing? No! Just become familiar with them, and develop a keen eye for reading documentation and quickly understanding functions.
