What is MySQL Workbench?
MySQL Workbench is just a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for us to interact with MySQL, one of the most popular relational databases in the world - through SQL commands.

We use MySQL Workbench when we are interacting with our databases because it will help us run some SQL queries. It also has a great interface where we can map out our tables and establish relationships between them.
