Why MySQL and Database Design?
In this day and age, you've probably created dozens of different accounts for different websites and services, all with their own login information. You've probably written messages in forums, 'liked' posts, or even uploaded and shared images, videos, or audio with other people across the internet. One thing in common across all these different websites is that you're always creating, manipulating, and saving data.

Besides the HTML and CSS that make up the view of a particular page, and the backend logic that dictates the functionality, there's also the database, which is in charge of your data! Databases are merely collections of organized information that can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. As a full-stack developer, you need to be familiar with building your database and designing the rules by which it stores data!

One of the most important things about database design is organizing your data to minimize repetition. Your database is the backbone of your application, and it is very important to understand how to properly organize it to maximize efficiency and minimize data queries. In this chapter, we will explore how to create relational database models and explore the different ways in which you can relate data using them.

Why ERD First?
ERD is short for 'Entity Relationship Diagram'. That's just a fancy way of saying that ERDs are essentially visual blueprints for how your database looks and behaves. ERDs and SQL work together very intimately. An ERD is a map of the structure of how we want to store our data, and SQL is the language we use to manipulate the data as per the relationships we defined in our ERD. Learning database design first will help us visualize how our relational databases look, making it much easier to pick up the actual SQL syntax.

Why ERD?
ERD is a process of laying out your tables and establishing relationships between them, making your data relational. Just about any data imaginable can be stored in a relational manner, there really isn't anything you can't do using a relational database like MySQL. Later, you will learn non-relational databases where everything is stored in a single table. There are pros and cons for both, but we find it's much easier to go from a relational database to a non-relational database.
